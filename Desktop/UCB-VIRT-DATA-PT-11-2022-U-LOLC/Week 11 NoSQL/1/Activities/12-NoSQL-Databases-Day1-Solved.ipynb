    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will practice importing data from your Terminal, updating data types, and exploring data in the Mongo Shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a command that imports the data from [annual_aqi_by_county_2022.csv](Resources/annual_aqi_by_county_2022.csv) to a database called `epa` and a collection called `annual_aqi_by_county`. If the collection already exists, drop the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a command that imports the data from [ohio_daily_records_2022.json](Resources/ohio_daily_records_2022.json) to a database called `epa` and a collection called `ohio_daily_records`. If the collection already exists, drop the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a command that imports the data from [ohio_jan_2022.json](Resources/ohio_jan_2022.json) to a database called `epa` and a collection called `ohio_air`. If the collection already exists, drop the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a command that imports the data from [ohio_feb_2022.json](Resources/ohio_feb_2022.json) to a database called `epa` and a collection called `ohio_air`. **Note:** This is the same collection used in the previous import so be sure not to drop the collection in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run `mongo` or `mongosh` from your Terminal and verify that your files imported correctly by writing commands to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use the `epa` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Show all the collections in the `epa` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Verify that there is data in each of the 3 collections (`ohio_daily_records`, `annual_aqi_by_county`, and `ohio_air`) by using `findOne()` to display an entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Verify that there is data from January 2022 in the `ohio_air` collection by searching on the `date_local` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Verify that there is data from February 2022 in the `ohio_air` collection by searching on the `date_local` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update the `DAILY_AQI_VALUE` nested under `CO` in the `ohio_daily_records` collection to change the string values to integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Update the `PERCENT_COMPLETE` nested under `CO` in the `ohio_daily_records` collection to change the string values to doubles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find a record in the `ohio_daily_records` collection where `CO.UNITS` matches \"ppm\" and `NO2.UNITS` matches \"ppb\". This will help us find sites that recorded values for carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dates for the `ohio_air` collection use the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nested records use dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember to use square brackets as part of your query when changing the data type of a field. Your `updateMany()` query should use the following convention: `updateMany({}, [ {'$set': \"field_name\": {'$toDataType': \"$field_name\"}} ])`.\n",
